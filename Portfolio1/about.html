   <h3>Reflection</h3>
  
   <p class="p1">I would like to share my experience with the web222 course, It was a really helpful 
       course and the material was lovely and smooth especially professor Navreet Singh Lehal
        make it easier to understand, and he explained everything steps by step. I liked working
        in HTML and CSS. The harder part was the JavaScript, it's not easy to deal with it. 
        All the assignments given by the professor were helpful in understanding the concept of
         the web development and how things work. It was a lovely to experience, and I am very
          excited to take the next step and learn more about web development next semester in the 
          web333 course. Lastly, I would like to improve my skills in JavaScript because I feel I
           need more experience to be professional in web development and the data manipulation 
           required to be more creative and have more skills to reach the goal of a professional
            web development.</p>
